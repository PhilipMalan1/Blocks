# Blocks
This is project made in XNA 4 for a highschool video game design class made by a group of 3 people. Blocks is a 2D platformer centered around throwing and jumping off of blocks. The game has 8 challenging levels which explore a variety of block-related mechanics.

# How it was made
The levels were built in a specially designed grid based level editor along with a custom (albiet buggy) physics engine which supports glancing collisions between circles and axis aligned rectangles.
